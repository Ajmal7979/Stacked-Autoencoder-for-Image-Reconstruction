# Stacked-Autoencoder-for-Image-Reconstruction



A stacked autoencoder is a type of deep neural network that learns to compress input data into a lower-dimensional representation (encoding), and then reconstructs the original data from that representation (decoding). In this project, you're applying this concept to reconstruct images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains small (32x32 pixel) color images from 10 different classes.




✅ 1. Dimensionality Reduction
Autoencoders learn compressed representations of data.

This helps in reducing storage, speeding up processing, and eliminating noise.

It can be used as a pre-processing step for other models.

✅ 2. Unsupervised Feature Learning
No labels are needed — the network learns meaningful features on its own.

These features can later be used in supervised tasks like classification or clustering.

✅ 3. Image Reconstruction & Compression
Rebuilding images from compressed data mimics how real-world systems (like JPEG compression) work.

It’s a practical application in file size reduction and storage optimization.

✅ 4. Foundation for Denoising and Anomaly Detection
The same architecture can be extended to detect anomalies, fraud, or damaged data.

In healthcare or industrial systems, autoencoders are used to detect abnormal X-rays, MRI scans, or equipment failure patterns.

✅ 5. Real-World Use Cases
